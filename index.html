        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>As a Computer Engineer graduated from the National University of Córdoba, I've always been deeply fascinated by open-source ideology. This passion for collaborative innovation has been a driving force throughout my journey in the tech industry. I thrive on learning and adapting to new technologies, with a strong focus on automation and efficiency.</p>
                <p>I enjoy understanding complex systems and optimizing processes to make them more streamlined and scalable. My expertise spans provisioning, containerization, database management, and observability, and I frequently work with tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes to build reliable and automated infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Throughout my career, I've engaged with various open-source projects and leveraged programming languages like Python, Go, and Bash scripting to solve real-world challenges. I excel at quickly grasping and implementing complex technologies, particularly those central to modern infrastructure and development workflows.</p>
                <p>Beyond technology, I have a deep passion for aviation, and I enjoy practicing paragliding in my free time.</p>
